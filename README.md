# png-decoder

A very rough PNG decoder. This repo is nothing more than a basic PNG decoder
implementation for further, finely turned development in my game engine 
(https://github.com/surafel911/qubit-engine).

After completion, this repo serves to prove that I have/can develop my own PNG
decoder/
